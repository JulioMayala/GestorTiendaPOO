# CLI Store Management System 

## About the Project
A Command-Line Interface (CLI) commercial management system developed through an iterative approach. The project models the complete business logic of a store, managing users (clients and cashiers), a complex inventory, and the lifecycle of purchase tickets. 

This repository stands out for its intensive use of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** and the preliminary architectural design using **UML diagrams**.

## Architecture and Technical Features
*   **Advanced Inventory Management:** Implemented inheritance to differentiate between standard products, customizable products (with dynamic surcharges), and time-limited services (food and events with expiration dates and preparation periods).
*   **Business Logic and Pricing:** Integrated algorithms for automatic final price calculation, applying cross-category discounts (MERCH, BOOK, ELECTRONICS, etc.) and personalization surcharges.
*   **Data Integrity:** Format validations (National ID/DNI, corporate emails, worker IDs) and strict management of ticket states (EMPTY, OPEN, CLOSE).

# La Mejor Tienda UPM 

# E2 Version
Ticket, inventory, Client/Cashier module.

This program should allow the end user to create/update/delete/list products. Create/remove/list registered cashiers and
clients. 

Using the products created, the end user should also have the ability to create a new ticket, adding in any product with
any amount (E1: less or equal than 100), remove products, or print the ticket (listing all products in ticket, applying
discounts, and showing to the end user product information, discounts applied, total price, discount amount, and final
price).

# Users

Any user is an entity which is modeled after a person. Any person has at least an identifier, name, and an
E-Mail address (contact).

**Note: the term "end user" refers to the user which is using this program, not any entity or User class
in the program design.**

## Cashier

A client is another kind of user which creates the ticket for the client.

A cashier is identified by their Worker ID (Starting with UW and a 7-digit number), name, and its company E-mail address (Ending in domain `@upm.es`)

- ID (Worker ID), must have format `UW#######`, starting with the `UW` prefix and 7 numbers
- Name
- Company E-mail address (Must en in domain `@upm.es`)

The cashier holds a list of tickets created by itself. If the cashier is removed, then **its associated tickets will be
also removed.**

## Cashier commands
    + cash add [<id>] "<name>" <email>
      Register a new cashier, email must be a company email address ending in "@upm.es".
      ID is optional, generate automatically if not specified.

    + cash remove <id>
      Remove the cashier with given ID.
      This operation will also erase any associated tickets with the specified cashier.
    
    + cash list
      List all registered cashiers ordered alphabetically by name. Do NOT show tickets created by
      this cashier.

    + cash tickets <workerID>
      Lists ticket IDs and ticket states created by the specified worker.

## Client

A client is a kind of user, which a cashier must register before creating any ticket.

A client is identified by their national ID number (Spain: DNI), name, and (personal) E-mail address. During the registration, the cashier who registered the client should be stored inside the Client as an attribute.

- ID (National ID) (Must be non-null, should have at least one character)
- Name
- E-Mail address, any E-mail address is possible
- Cashier which registered the client, cashierID must be valid

## Client commands
    + client add "<name>" <id> <email> <cashierID>
      Register a new client with specified CashierID. 
      CashierID should be associated to a valid cashier.
      ID would be the client's national ID.
    
    + client remove <id>
      Removes a client from the registry.
      Note: this would NOT remove any ticket associated to the client.

    + client list
      Lists all registered client's information (id, name, email, cashier) ordered alphabetically by name.

# Products
The products are split into two kinds, products with expiry time, and normal products.

**Note: price calculation will be detailed in the [Ticket](#tickets) section**

## Normal products

Normal products could refer to any object, such as T-Shirts, books, pens and mugs.

Attributes: ID, Name, Price, Category, Customization Amount (Customizations would be a list of strings, Customization
amount refers to the size of the list).

- ID must be positive (0 should be invalid)
- Name must be less than 100 characters (E1 Restriction)
- Price (per piece) must be positive (0 is invalid)
- Category fixed with discount rates: MERCH(0%), STATIONERY(5%), CLOTHES(7%), BOOK(10%), ELECTRONICS(3%)
- Amount of customizations (0 or undefined means non-customizable product), once set then it could not be altered.
Product A and Product B are different if they have different IDs.

For E1: No more than 200 different products

Any normal product now has the option to be customized, when adding the product to the inventory, the end user may
specify how many customizations a product can have. And using `ticket add --p` command to specify what customization
will be present in the product.

Adding a customization to a normal product during `ticket add` will add 10% to the cost of the product (1 customization
= 10% added cost, 2 = 20%, 3 = 30%, until the Customization Amount limit specified during the product registration in
Inventory). Any customizable product (normal product registered in the inventory with customization amount > 0) can be
added to ticket with or without any customizations.

After the product is registered in the inventory, the end user will be unable to alter the number of customization that any product can bear.

## Timed product

Timed products (or product with time limitation) is usually a kind of service, which could not be added before a certain time to the ticket.

A timed product is a product in inventory which has an expiration date and a preparation period. After passing the expiration date, the product could not be added to any ticket.
The preparation period is a time period placed before the expiration date, during this period, the product could not be added to any ticket. There are two kinds of product with time limitation, **food** which has a preparation period of 72 hours, and **meetings** which has 12 hours.

For example: a food catering service with pizza and pasta, with specified expiration date of 24th November 2025 @ 00:00.
Such service may be added at any time before 21st November 2025 @ 00:00.
During 21st and 24th, this product is in the preparation period and could not be added to any ticket.

- ID must be positive (0 should be invalid)
- Name must be less than 100 characters (E1 Restriction)
- Price (per person) must be positive (0 is invalid)
- Maximum amount of participants (must be less or equal than 100)
- Expiration date
- Product A and Product B are different if they have different IDs.

Preparation period is dependent on the kind of product (food: 72h or meeting: 12h). 

## Commands for Products:
	+ prod add [<id>] "<name>" <category> <price> [<MaxPersonalizationAmount>]
	  Add a new normal product to the inventory. The product may be personalized specifying the maximum
      amount for the customization string list. Set to 0 if not specified.
      ID is now optional. ID will be generated automatically if omitted.

    + prod addFood [<id>] "<name>" <price> <expiration: yyyy-MM-dd> <maxPeople>
      Add a new timed product (Food) to the inventory. This kind of product has a preparation period of 72h.
      <expiration> should follow strictly by the yyyy-mm-dd format (e.g. 2025-11-25)
      ID is now optional. ID will be generated automatically if omitted.
    
    + prod addMeeting [<id>] "<name>" <price> <expiration: yyyy-MM-dd> <maxPeople>
      Add a new timed product (Meeting) to the inventory. This kind of product has a preparation period of 12h.
      <expiration> should follow strictly by the yyyy-mm-dd format (e.g. 2025-11-25)
      ID is now optional. ID will be generated automatically if omitted.

	+ prod list
      List all registered products (normal products and products with time limitations)
	
	+ prod update <id> <field> <value>
  	  Update specific attributes of a specific product, checking restrictions on values.
      Possible values for <field>: NAME|CATEGORY|PRICE
      Update category will be an invalid operation on products with time limitations, since these kind of product
      does not have an category field.

	+ prod remove <id>
      Remove products, eliminate appearances in ticket <-- Unspecified but we should assume this behaviour to prevent inconsistencies

# Tickets

A list containing products, product amount, and if applicable, customizations (Normal product), participants (Timed Product only).

The ticket will be associated to one of 3 states:
- EMPTY (The ticket is empty, no products were added, and more products can be added)
- OPEN (The ticket contains at least one product, and more products can be added)
- CLOSE (No more products can be added to this ticket)

Once a ticket is closed, the end user should be able to print the ticket again specifying the corresponding Cashier ID
and Ticket ID.

**For E1: No more than 100 items (sum of all amount of products contained in ticket's product list <= 100)**

A timed product with any arbitrary amount of participants in the ticket should be counted as 1 item. For example, a
pizza catering service with 30 participants (50 max.) should be counted as one item in the ticket.

A timed product with the same ID could not be added again to the same ticket.

Ticket price calculation: if there are 2 or more products of the same category, the product in question should be
discounted at the rate (percentage) mentioned in Product Category.

If a product is customizable but during `ticket add` no customization is added, sell as a normal product without any
additional costs (0 customization = 0% added cost)

**Important: customized product should be eligible for category discounts. The price to subtract is the price of the
product after the added cost due to customizations, multiplied by the category discount percentage**

```
customizationPercent = numCustomizations * 10% (numCustomizations: amount of customization strings specified during ticket add)
productPriceWithCustomization = baseProductPrice + (baseProductPrice * customizationPercent)
                                                    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
                                                      Additional cost due to customization
finalProductPrice = productPriceWithCustomization - (productPriceWithCustomization * categoryPercent)
                                                     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
                                                      Cost to discount according to product category
```

**For E1: No more than 100 different items (sum of all added product counts) should be allowed inside the ticket.**

I.e. Add `50 Product A` in ticket (50 items), add `50 Product B` (50 items) in ticket. Now that the total items in the ticket is **100 (50 Prod. A + 50 Prod. B)**, **no more items** are allowed to be added.

## Ticket ID

All tickets are now identified with an ID. During ticket creation (`ticket new` command), the ID will be generated
automatically if not specified. The automatically generated ID will have the following format:
`YY-MM-dd-HH:mm-#####` where YY:year (2 digit), MM:month (2 digit), dd:day (2 digit), HH:hour (24-hour format),
mm:minute, #####: random 5-digit number.

When the ticket is closed, the ticket ID will change, appending the date/time when the ticket is closed.

Examples:

Assuming ticket open date will be always 16/11/2025 11:53, and ticket close date will be always 19/11/2025 16:41, random
5-digit number will be always 00721.

When ticket ID is generated automatically:

- Created: `25-11-16-11:53-00721`
- Closed: `25-11-16-11:53-00721-25-11-19-16:41`

When ticket ID is explicitly specified (For example: 157194)

- Created: `157194`
- Closed: `157194-25-11-19-16:41`

Observation: when ticket ID is specified, the opening date and random 5-digit number is replaced entirely with
the ticket ID specified. But closing the ticket will still append the closing date of the ticket.

Observation 2: looking at the E2 specification, it looks like the ID is implemented with a string, it is uncertain
if the ticket ID should allow non-numeric IDs (Such as `21263s`, closing -> `21263s-25-11-19-16:41`)

Observation 3: to print any closed ticket, it is uncertain if the end user should specify the full
ticket ID with the closing date, or any part matching the ID unambiguously should suffice.
For example:

- Generated ID: `25-11-16-11:53-00721-25-11-19-16:41`, or `25-11-16-11:53-00721`, even `25-11-16-11:53` or `00721`
  if unambiguous
- Custom ID: `157194-25-11-19-16:41`, or `157194`, even `25-11-19-16:41` if unambiguous

## Commands for Ticket
	+ ticket new [<ID>] <CashierID> <ClientID>
  	  Create new empty ticke and associate it to a valid cashier and client.
      ID will be generated automatically if omitted.
  
	+ ticket add <ticketID> <cashierID> <productID> <quantity> [--p<customization> --p<customization2> ... --p<customizationN>]
  	  Add items to ticket, specifying product ID and the amount to add, calls print internally but does not close the ticket.
      <cashierID> must be the cashier ID which the ticket was associated during the ticket creation.   
      Customizations are specified via --p argument.
  
	+ ticket remove <productID> <cashierID> <productID>
  	  Remove all appearance of product in ticket, including customized products.
      Calls print internally but does not close the ticket
      <cashierID> must be the cashier ID which the ticket was associated during the ticket creation. 

	+ ticket print <ticketID> <cashierID>
	  Prints current ticket with product information and discount.
      Calculate total price, discount amount, and discounted total price.
      Product listing should be in alphabetical order. And closes the ticket.

    + ticket list
      Lists all tickets IDs created and their states, ordered by Cashier's ID.
      For example: UW0000001 has 222222, UW0000002 has 212121, 222121. This command will list
      ticket IDs created by UW0000001 and then ticket IDs created by UW0000002.
      222222 - EMPTY
      212121 - CLOSED
      222121 - OPEN

## Exit command

### `exit`

Closing application.
Goodbye!
```

# Other requirements

To turn in:
- Source code, JAR package --> Moodle
- UML (PNG, JPG, SVG). **Explain library usages.**

Others:
- Source code must be compilable.
- Input/Output should be mostly matching input/output examples in E2 statement. Specially command formats.
- Creating more commands outside what is defined in E1/E2 statement is prohibited.
- Project exposition/defense: project must be able to execute all commands without any errors and following expected
behaviour.

# Other comments

- Command keywords are expected to be lowercase and category keywords are expected to be uppercase (E1 does not specify,
but hinted with example outputs)
- The **assumptions** outlined in E1 (200 different products max. and 100 items max. in ticket) are currently treated
as hard limitations in our project
- E1 restriction has remained in E2
